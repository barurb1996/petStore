Simple project to test /pet POST endpoint which allows creating new pet

Test implemented:
Create, Read, Update, Delete pet.
Unsuccessful creation of a pet.
Deletion of non-existing pet.
Retrieval of non-existing pet.

I tried to test the authorization and scopes but for some reason it seems it does not work properly.
With or without being authorized with specific scopes I had accessed to all the resources.

To run the tests execute command:
`npx cucumber-js`
